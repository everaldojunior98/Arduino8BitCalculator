![Circuit6](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/everaldojunior98/Arduino8BitCalculator/master/Circuits/27-05.png)
Adding non-entire division.
### 26/05/20
![Circuit5](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/everaldojunior98/Arduino8BitCalculator/master/Circuits/26-05.png)
Adding other functions, subtraction (based on twos complement), multiplication and division (only integer division).
Adding led to indicate the number sign.
### 25/05/20
![Circuit4](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/everaldojunior98/Arduino8BitCalculator/master/Circuits/25-05.png)
Adding base to make other operations (div, mult, sub).
### 21/05/20
![Circuit3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/everaldojunior98/Arduino8BitCalculator/master/Circuits/21-05.png)
Adding a button to make the sum. Adding verification in overflow case. Finalizing the circuit.
### 20/05/20
![Circuit2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/everaldojunior98/Arduino8BitCalculator/master/Circuits/20-05.png)
Adding a constructor with the parameters of each number. Adding function to read button data (based on button state). Implementing the ripple-carry adder. Removing initialization from void setup for the constructor.
### 19/05/20
![Circuit1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/everaldojunior98/Arduino8BitCalculator/master/Circuits/19-05.png)
Created the first circuit sketch using the 595, added the class to represent the numbers (including the multiplexer configurations), created the full adder, and the base for the ripple-carry adder.
